                <button class="faq-toggle"><h4>Do you tutor online or in person?</h4></button>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>Currently, I tutor exclusively via <a href="https://www.zoom.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zoom</a>, which allows me to tutor students from around the world.</p>

                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>Typically, either 60 or 90 minutes.</p>

                <button class="faq-toggle"><h4>Should I take the ACT or SAT?</h4></button>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>I'd suggest taking a practice test for both, and seeing which test you prefer. Historically, the SAT has been more "tricky" and the ACT has placed more of an emphasis on speed, but this might change with the advent of the new SAT format and online testing beginning in 2024.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-toggle"><h4>When is the best time to start preparing for the SAT or ACT? </h4></button>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>Many students start prep the summer before junior year. A bit earlier is OK too.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-toggle"> <h4>Why should I work with you instead of Princeton Review, Kaplan, (other big test company)? </h4></button>
                <div class="faq-content">
                     <p>I worked for one of these large companies for five years, so I know what their flaws are. Their tutors are handed a script and often have little experience or knowledge about the test. Also, these companies promote a “one size fits all” approach that isn’t customized to students’ individual needs. At the company I worked at, instructors supposedly needed a 90th percentile score (1290 on the SAT) to get hired, but the company didn’t even verify instructors’ scores. I’ve seen instructors who didn’t understand basic math concepts trying to teach these concepts to students. You know what you are getting with me—someone with a proven track record of student success. In addition, I charge much less than the companies I mentioned.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-toggle">   <h4>Do you offer a guaranteed score increase? </h4></button>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>Due to the individual nature of test prep and the difficulty of predicting score improvements, I do not offer such a guarantee. In fact, I encourage you to read the fine print for any such guarantee—companies usually don’t give you your money back. Instead, they offer a free online class or something. Why would the free class help if it didn’t help the first time?</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-toggle"><h4> What did you get on the SAT, ACT, GRE, etc.? </h4></button>
                <div class="faq-content">
                     <p>I scored 2370/2400 on the old SAT and 339/340 on the GRE. I don't think scores are what make someone a good teacher—I know many brilliant people who can't explain to a student how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. (But you did ask!) I'd say what makes a good tutor is the ability to explain topics in an engaging way, a deep understanding of the tests, and patience and empathy toward students (it's a hard time to be a high school student!) </p>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <button class="faq-toggle"><h4>Tutors are expensive. Plus, I'm a pretty self-motivated kid. Do I need a tutor? </h4></button>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>I get it. While some tutors will tell you everyone should get private tutoring, the fact is that (1) tutoring isn't right for everyone, and (2) finances prevent everyone from having equitable access to tutoring. The truth is that self-preparation can be accomplished at a very low cost. I’d be happy to suggest a self-study plan and free resources to any self-motivated students.</p>

                <button class="faq-toggle"> <h4>What materials do you use? </h4></button>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>I’m a big stickler for using official materials whenever possible. Third-party materials (Princeton Review, Kaplan, etc.) are often inaccurate in emulating the tone, difficulty level, and structure of the actual test. The main books I use are the SAT blue book, the ACT red book, and the ETS official guides for the GRE. I also use materials by professional tutors such as Erica Meltzer, that are widely read and have proven to be of high quality.</p>
