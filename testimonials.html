            <p>I would highly recommend Ed as an SAT/ACT tutor. Ed was very flexible with assigning work given other obligations during the school year. I also enjoyed how the sessions focused on what I felt needed improving based on previous section scores, so we were really able to improve upon the areas where I was struggling. When it comes to teaching the material, Ed is very knowledgeable, methodical, and patient in making sure his students are prepared for every question type, and also is a friendly individual who is great to converse with about the college process. It is very evident he wants his students to succeed because he is always willing to put in a few extra minutes past the session time to help his students grasp an extra concept.

            <p>Other than the fact that Ed is friendly, smart, and extremely helpful, what I loved most about Ed was that he took the time to understand his students. Able to cater his curriculum to individual needs, Ed is the perfect tutor for anyone, whether they are a fast learner wanting to get those couple extra points or somebody who is behind and needs extra help. Even though I was someone who always had too much pride to ask for a tutor, I have no regrets taking Ed’s class because he showed respect to all of his students, looked at everything with a positive attitude, and consequently greatly improved my test-taking skills and my SAT score. Everyone I know who has had Ed loves him: he is an interesting guy who cares about his students and has a good balance of both serious and easygoing. <span>-Kira (scored 1580/1600, now attends a top engineering school)</span></p>

            <p>Ed is an excellent tutor and greatly improved my SAT score …. he has extensive knowledge about both the SAT and ACT, and spends as much time as needed to ensure that you understand the layout and content of the test. Ed is also a very kind and understanding tutor. With Ed’s help, I was accepted by an engineering  school, and  I would highly recommend him to any friends planning on taking the SAT or ACT.  <span>-Jon M., tutoring student</span></p>

            <p>While taking an SAT class taught by Ed over the summer, I was able to greatly improve my score…ultimately scoring a 1560/1600. Some of the things I liked best about learning from Ed were how he was able to help me specifically target and improve upon areas I needed to work on, improve my time management while taking the test, and especially improve my reading comprehension skills, as the Reading section was the part that I originally struggled the most with. Even though the class I took was relatively short, Ed helped me build up my skills over time so that I felt increasingly confident and well-prepared as the test approached. <span>-SAT student, summer 2017</span></p>
