            <p>
                Do SAT, ACT, or GRE exams have you scratching your head? You're not alone! I've been in the tutoring game since 2013, helping awesome students like you get a grip on these tricky tests. Together, we'll build some killer reasoning and thinking skills that you can use, not just for these exams, but for any future challenges too.

                Over the years, Iâ€™ve cheered on students as they joined some pretty cool colleges â€“ from local gems to big names. And guess what? I bet there's a perfect fit out there for you too.

                Beyond the exams, if you're looking for someone to add some pizzazz to your college essays or simply help you tell your unique story, I've got your back. Fun fact: I once wrote about my adventures working at Burger King for a college essay. Yup, it's all about showcasing YOU!

                A little about me? I've got a recent masterâ€™s in ethnomusicology from <a href="https://www.wesleyan.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wesleyan</a> and a bachelorâ€™s in music from <a href="https://tcnj.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the College of New Jersey</a>. So if you're into tunes or just want to chat about the latest hits, I'm your guy!

                Can't wait to embark on this learning journey with you. Let's make it fun! ðŸš€
